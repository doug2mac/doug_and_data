<li>Providing evidence as to whether or not an institution is achieving its
mission is crucial for students, parents, and stakeholders across higher

its impact on higher education only strengthens the need to reassure
constituents that an institution is able to achieve its mission even in
these unprecedented times. This webinar will draw on the experience of
the Community College of Beaver County (CCBC) and will help attendees
understand processes to develop key performance indicators (KPIs)
reflective of clear and simple metrics.</li>
